## Test Scenarios
Writing test scenarios for manual testing is an essential step in the quality assurance process. Test scenarios help ensure that all possible actions and workflows within the application are tested effectively.

## Test Case Writing
Main part of the project. After doing all the things that helps to write and execute the test cases more specific. In this project all the test cases have been executed without having any delay. 
- **Total Test Cases:** 40 
- **Passed:** 38  
- **Failed:** 2
